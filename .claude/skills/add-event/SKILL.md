  Add a One Omega Foundation chapter event to the oneomegachicago.org website

  image, or raw event details (title, date, time, location, host chapter,
  ticketing link) and wants it on the Events page / calendar. Trigger on
  "add this event", "new event submission", "a chapter sent in an event",
  "put this on the calendar", "update the events", or when given a flyer plus
  details for the One Omega / Chicago Conclave site — even if they don't say
  the word "skill". Also use to move a finished event to the past ("Looking
  Back") section or refresh an event's flyer/link.

# Add a One Omega event

This skill captures the repeatable intake workflow for the One Omega Foundation
website (repo: `shaft615/oneomegachicago`, deployed on Vercel). Chapters submit
events; the Foundation curates them into a static data file that drives the
Events page, the homepage featured banner, and the calendar. There is no
database — everything is a typed entry in `src/data/events.ts` plus a flyer
image in `public/events/`, committed to git. A push triggers a Vercel deploy.

Your job: turn a submission into a correct, committed, deployed event with no
broken images, wrong dates, or fabricated facts.

## Step 0 — Read the ground truth first

Before writing anything, **read these two files** so you match the current shape
exactly (the schema and conventions evolve — don't trust this doc over the code):

- `src/data/events.ts` — the `Event` interface, all existing entries (copy their
  style), and the helper functions (`sortByStart`, `groupByDay`, `isoDateKey`,
  `isEventPast`).
- `src/components/FeaturedEventCard.tsx` — how each field renders, so you know
  which fields produce which buttons/badges.

## Step 1 — Gather the inputs

A submission gives you some or all of: submitter name/email, event title, host
chapter, category, date, start/end time, location, description, registration
link, recurrence, notes, and possibly a **flyer** (an attached image from the
Formspree Professional inbox, a pasted image, or a file already dropped in
`public/events/`).

### Pulling submissions directly from Formspree (Phase-1 API intake)

When the user asks to "pull/check the latest event submissions" rather than
pasting an email, fetch them from Formspree's Submissions API instead:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-event-submissions.mjs            # recent submissions, human-readable
node scripts/fetch-event-submissions.mjs --json     # raw payload (shows file/flyer URLs)
node scripts/fetch-event-submissions.mjs --since 2026-05-01T00:00:00
```

The script reads `FORMSPREE_API_KEY` from the environment or a gitignored
`.env.local`. If it errors with "FORMSPREE_API_KEY not set", tell the user to
add the key (Form → Settings → HTTP API in Formspree) — never ask them to paste
the key into the chat, and never commit it. The form defaults to the Chapter
Event Submissions form (`mnjwnozy`).

To find which submissions are NEW (not already on the site), read the current
`events` array in `src/data/events.ts` and compare titles/dates — skip any
that already have an entry. Then process each genuinely new submission through
the steps below. If a submission included an uploaded flyer, the raw `--json`
output is where its file URL appears; download it into `public/events/` (or, if
that isn't cleanly possible, draft the entry and ask the user to drop the flyer
file and confirm the filename).

If anything required is missing or ambiguous (no time, bare venue name with no
city, unclear host), **ask rather than guess**. Never fabricate dates,
addresses, or facts about real chapters or people.

## Curation — does this belong on the public calendar?

Not every submission should be posted. The Events page is a public,
community-facing forum. Post public-facing events: fundraisers, galas, community
service drives, socials, scholarship programs, wellness days, brunches — anything
the chapters want the broader community to attend or know about.

**Skip internal chapter business** — routine chapter meetings, council sessions,
members-only logistics — unless the user explicitly says to include it. When a
submission looks internal (e.g. a recurring "Chapter Meeting", an officers'
call), don't post it; flag it and confirm with the user first. This judgment
matters most for unattended/automated intake, where there's no human pre-filter
before things would otherwise go live.

## Step 2 — Place the flyer (if there is one)

Flyers live in `public/events/`. Confirm the file is on disk with `ls`. Use a
clear, URL-safe name following the existing pattern, e.g. `LakeJam_2026.jpeg`,
`Coleman-Love_2026.jpg`. The `flyer` field path must match the filename on disk
**exactly**, including extension and case — production (Vercel/Linux) is
case-sensitive even though local Windows is not.

If the submitter provided the flyer as a link or attachment you can't save
directly, ask the user to drop it in `public/events/` and tell you the filename.

## Step 3 — Map to the Event schema

Build the entry. Key conventions (verify against `src/data/events.ts`):

- **id**: unique slug, usually `event-name-year` (e.g. `lake-jam-2026`).
- **hostChapter**: the chapter's **designation only** (the Greek/abbreviation
  badge, e.g. `ΧΛΛ`, `ΣΩ`, `ΜΞ`, `ΝΠ`, `ΡΓΓ`, `AKK`). Leave undefined for
  Foundation-wide events. **host**: the full descriptive string
  (e.g. `"Mu Xi Chapter (ΜΞ), Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc."`). The 13 chapter
  designations live in `src/data/chapters.ts` — read it if unsure.
- **start / end**: ISO 8601 **with Central Time offset**. This is the #1 source
  of bugs — get the offset right:
  - **CDT = `-05:00`** roughly mid-March through early November (daylight time)
  - **CST = `-06:00`** roughly early November through mid-March (standard time)
  - June event → `-05:00`. December event → `-06:00`.
  - Events crossing midnight (e.g. an NYE party ending 2 AM) set `end` to the
    next calendar day; ISO handles it.
- **dateLabel / timeLabel**: human-readable strings shown on cards
  (e.g. `"Saturday, June 13, 2026"`, `"6:00 PM – Midnight"`). The calendar
  positions by `start`; humans read these.
- **category**: pick from the set used in existing entries / the submission form
  (Community, Wellness, Scholarship, Brotherhood, Foundation, Conclave 2028,
  Service, Social, Other).
- **description**: array of paragraphs. Each element renders as its own `<p>`.
- **status**: `"upcoming"` for future events. (`isEventPast()` auto-moves events
  to the past section once their end time passes, so you don't have to flip this
  for every old event — but see Step 6.)

Optional CTA / display fields (only set what applies):

- **link** — primary external URL (ticketing/RSVP). Renders "Tickets & Details →".
- **secondaryLink** / **secondaryLinkLabel** — second outline button (e.g. an
  event website alongside a ticketing link).
- **registerHref** — in-page anchor (e.g. `"#register"`) for a registration form
  on the same page; renders a gold "Register below ↓" CTA (full variant only).
- **nominationHref** / **nominationLabel** — nomination/application form button.
  Internal route (`/events/...`) → client-side `Link`; external → new tab.
- **additionalCalendarDates** — `["YYYY-MM-DD", ...]` extra calendar cells for a
  multi-day drive so one entry shows on every relevant day without fragmenting
  into multiple entries.
- **callout** — single emphasized gold banner line (great for "Arrive early…"
  or a post-event "🎉 Thank you to everyone who came out!").
- **recurrence** — free-form label ("Annual", "Quarterly"); shows a "↻" badge.
- **featured** — at most ONE upcoming event. Don't add a second featured event
  without confirming which should hold the slot.

## Step 4 — Insert into events.ts

Add the object to the `events` array. Order doesn't affect correctness (the
calendar and galleries sort by `start` at runtime), but insert near its
chronological neighbors to keep the file readable. Keep the featured event near
the top by convention.

## Step 5 — Verify before building

- **Day-of-week check**: confirm the weekday in `dateLabel` actually matches the
  date. A flyer that says "Saturday, June 13" should compute to a Saturday — if
  your `start` date lands on a different weekday, something's off. Flag it.
- **Flyer path** matches a real file in `public/events/` (exact name + case).
- No fabricated detail slipped in.

## Step 6 — Moving an event to the past ("Looking Back")

When an event has happened, the curated move is: set `status: "past"` and add a
`callout` with a thank-you message (e.g.
`"🎉 Thank you to everyone who came out!"`). The `PastEventHighlights` section
shows past events that have a flyer; `FlyerEventGallery` shows upcoming ones.
The `isEventPast()` helper already hides finished events from the upcoming
gallery automatically based on end time, but the explicit flip + thank-you
callout is what makes it appear nicely in Looking Back.

## Step 7 — Build, commit, push

Run from the repo root. **Always build before committing** — it catches type
errors and bad imports, and the OneDrive location needs the `.next` cleanup:

```bash
rm -rf .next && npm run build
```

The build is clean when you see `✓ Compiled successfully` and the static route
list with `○ (Static)` — `/events` should be in it.

Then commit and push. **Fetch first** — the Foundation sometimes commits
directly via the GitHub web editor, so the local branch may be behind; rebase to
avoid a rejected push:

```bash
git fetch origin
# if behind, rebase local work on top:
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main   # >0 means behind
git rebase origin/main                   # only if behind and you have local commits
git add public/events/<flyer> src/data/events.ts
git commit -m "Add <Event> (<Chapter>)"
git push
```

Use a HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages. Stage specific files (the flyer +
events.ts), not `git add -A`. Co-author the commit per repo convention:
`Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Step 8 — Report back

Tell the user concisely: what landed, where it surfaces (which gallery / which
calendar day), the commit hash, and that Vercel deploys in ~60s. Remind them to
hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) since flyers are CDN-cached, especially if a flyer
was replaced under an unchanged filename.

## Common pitfalls (learned the hard way)

- **Wrong TZ offset** puts the event on the wrong calendar day. June = `-05:00`.
- **Filename case/extension mismatch** → broken image in production only.
- **`.next` not cleaned** on OneDrive → `EINVAL readlink` build error; `rm -rf .next` first.
- **Push rejected** → someone committed to `origin/main`; fetch + rebase, don't force.
- **Two featured events** → only one may be `featured: true`.
- **Replacing a flyer under the same filename** → looks unchanged until a hard
  refresh because the URL didn't change; mention this to the user.
